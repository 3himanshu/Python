3. find the sum of sequence by skipping the between elements without using slicing.
    Ex seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] where x = 4, y = 7
       skip elements between x and y(including x and y i,e. [4, 5, 6, 7]) always y
       comes after x
       output: 1+2+3+8+9 = 23

>6. Difference between __new__ and __init__ ??

2) Permutation of ABC
3) Input string "aaabccdee" then output "3ab2cd2e"
4) Validstings
      {}
      ({})
      [{()}]

      and invalid string
       (}
       {{)}
       [{[{()})]
